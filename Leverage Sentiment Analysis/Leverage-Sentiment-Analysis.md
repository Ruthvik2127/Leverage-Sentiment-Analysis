ðŸ‘‰ For companies that own many product lines and launch new products, understanding customersâ€™ needs and getting quick feedback is core to their business and success. Such insights
have historically been drawn from manual market research (e.g. hard-copy surveys and phone calls), but digital channels are becoming key sources of competitive intelligence and 
customer data. As of 2019, there were 4.5 billion internet users, nearly 2 billion digital buyers, and 3.8 billion active social-media users. This massive audience generates a 
significant amount of data, 80% of which is unstructured. Although organizations derive intelligence from the other 20%, the structured dataset, unstructured data can drive 
results if captured and processed properly.

ðŸ‘‰ This data can distill meaningful social sentiments at scale, which is extremely valuable when formulating business strategies. Leaders in many sectors have gained competitive 
 advantage by successfully churning this kind of data into insights and actions such as launching new products, informing product development, and improving customer care.

ðŸ‘‰ For example, if a customer care center receives a complaint about the change of a productâ€™s smell, it is difficult to assess how many total customers share the same sentiment.
 Similarly, in market research, a large proportion of customers who receive free samples might be overly complementary or critical of the product, while opinions from genuine 
 online consumers might be completely different. Yet how can companies address the business impact of changes in customer sentiments if theyâ€™re unable to accurately interpret the
 data in a sentiment analysis?

## Our Recommended Approach
ðŸ‘‰ To get comprehensive insights, an organization must gather all forms of customer feedback, including care-center interactions and new-product survey feedback from the companyâ€™s
own portal, along with customer reviews on e-commerce sites like Amazon, user blogs, and video sites such as YouTube. This requires the company to engage in a thorough data 
discovery project involving data acquisition, cleansing, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), sentiment analysis, business analysis, and insight presentation.

ðŸ‘‰ Organizations will also need an analytical platform to ingest these datasets and develop a brand- and product-level data model iteratively. Wiproâ€™s Data Discovery Platform enables 
companies to gain insights based on raw data, accessing the platform step by step to deepen their understanding of the information and the potential responses. The process can
leverage Pythonâ€™s NLP data libraries as a start, and gradually build up a library of texts attuned to the brandâ€™s features. Each step in this model feeds into the next, as shown
below.
